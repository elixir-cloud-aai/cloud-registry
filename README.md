## Synopsis

GA4GH Service Registry API implementation for the ELIXIR Cloud. The registry is
currently deployed at [https://cloud-registry.rahtiapp.fi][deploy_url], but
will likely move soon.

## Description

Service entries comply with the [`ExternalService` schema][schema-service]
defined in the [GA4GH Service Registry API][ga4gh-registry].

For developers, an API documentation (of the code, not the exposed API) is
available [here][docs-api].

## Usage

Once [deployed](#Installation), the API will be served here:

```text
http://localhost:8080/ga4gh/registry/v1/
```

You can explore the service via the [Swagger UI][url-swagger].

> Note that host and port can be adapted in the [`docker-compose`
> configuration][config]. In that case, the values in the URLs above need to be
> updated accordingly.

[Endpoints][schema-endpoints] can be probed with `curl`, for example:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/ga4gh/registry/v1/services" -H  "accept: application/json"
```

## Installation

To quickly install the service for development/testing purposes, we recommend
deployment via [`docker-compose`][docker-compose], as described below. For
more durable deployments on cloud native infrastructure, we also provide a
[Helm][helm] chart in the [`deployments/`][deployment] directory, together with
[basic deployment instructions][deployment-instructions] (details may need to
be adapted for your specific infrastructure).

### Requirements

The following software needs to be available on your system:

- [`git 2.17.1`][git]
- [`docker 18.09.6`][docker]
- [`docker-compose 1.23.1`][docker-compose]

> Versions used to test deployment are indicated. Other versions with the same
> major version numbers will likely work as well, especially newer ones.

### Deployment

First, clone the repository and traverse into the root directory with:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:elixir-cloud-aai/cloud-registry.git
cd cloud-registry
```

Then simply start up the service with:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

_**That't it!**_

You should now be able to use/explore the API as described in
the [usage section](#Usage).

#### Other useful commands

To shut down the service, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

If you need to inspect the logs, call:

```bash
docker-compose logs
```
