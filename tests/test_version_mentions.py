"""Tests that the current release version is not hard-coded (drift guard).

The release version has one source (see "Versioning and releases" in
`docs/development.md`): the release tag and, on `dev`, the `version` of
`CITATION.cff`. The docs and the chart's README write it as `{{ version }}`
(replaced by `docs/hooks.py` and `scripts/chart_readme.py`); comments,
templates and tests use placeholders (e.g., `1.2.3`) and refer to sections by
anchor. So the current release version may only appear in the files and lines
of the allowlist below, which are about that release itself, not about the
latest one.
